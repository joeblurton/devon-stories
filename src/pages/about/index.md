title: About Devon Stories

I started Devon Stories in the summer of 2020 to showcase Devon’s rich cultural and natural heritage. I’d like to talk a little about what motivated me.

I first came to Devon to study Archaeology at the University of Exeter, already deeply in love with the place. I grew up in Somerset, arguably a very beautiful place in its own right. Somehow, however, I felt restless. Perhaps I equated the flatness of Somerset with dullness.

From the moment I could drive I took every opportunity to pootle over the Blackdown Hills, exploring Devon in my beloved old Morris Minor. This often seemed a challenging, epic journey, although that’s hard to believe now! I camped out with friends, joined sing-alongs in the folk clubs that scatter the county, met many wonderful people, and decided that Devon was where I wanted to be.

Later I learnt that my mother’s family had roots in Devon. Many of the living members all migrated across the Blackdowns at the same time over a decade ago, and I have come to believe that, as a tribe, we simply belong here. 

Devon feels more homely than any other place I’ve been to in the world, and I find new hidden treasures every day. There is so much heritage per-square-mile that the county constantly rewards my curiosity. 

The fruits of that curiosity are what I wanted to share in this very irregular online magazine. It’s intended to highlight those interesting little details that might otherwise disappear out of the corner of your eye as you drive past on a lazy Sunday morning. I hope it delights you as much as Devon delights me.
